Exact steps to follow:
 These were the files i used ( for kickstart file go to ks_katello.cfg and rename it ks.cfg and use it as you like)
 1. CentOS-7-x86_64-Everything-2003.iso
 2. kickstart.iso

 The steps we have to do on HYPER-V host machine ( the machine we use as a Hyper-V server - I am using windows 10 PRO )

	• To install Centos 7 with Kickstart file we have to do the following:
		○ Generate ks.cfg file from the internet or any old installed centos 7.
		○ Make it an iso with this command
			§ genisoimage -V OEMDRV -o kickstart.iso /myfile/ks.cfg - I used WSL2 Ubuntu to run this command.
			§ This above will create an iso kickstart.iso which we can load to new Hyper-V VM.
		○ Now we need to add two DVD to the newly created VM.
			§ 1st one is Centos 7_Installation_DVD
			§ 2nd one is kickstart.iso
		○ The new VM will auto pick up the kickstart file to start the auto installation.
		○ REMEMBER to disable Secure Boot in the settings of the VM.
